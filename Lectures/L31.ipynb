    "\n",
    "In order to understand optical instruments we need to consider how [our eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye) process incoming light from objects to visualize them. The first refraction for incoming light occurs when light passes from air to the cornea (n~1.376), and the lens (n=1.386-1.406) is adjusted by the muscles around it to accommodate objects at different distances. The eye has a near point which is the shortest distance at which it can focus on an object. This varies from person to person, and with age, but is typically on the order of 25cm.\n",

    "\n",
    "The biggest possible size of an object on the eye without the aid of an optical instrument is obtained by placing it at the near point of the eye $N$. If we bring an object closer than the near point then it will occupy a larger angle, but we won't be able to focus on it. This problem can be addressed by a magnifying glass. If we place an object closer than the focal length of the lens, it will produce a virtual image at a distance $d_{i}$. The maximum magnification is achieved by bringing the lens right up to your eye and then arranging the lens, object and your head so that the image is at the near point. To find the magnification we need to know $d_{o}$  which can be found from the lens equation, taking $d_{i}=-N$\n",

    "Several fabrication difficulties involved in making large refracting telescopes can be overcome by making [reflecting telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflector_telescope) which use mirrors in the place of an objective lens.  It is much easier to make a large mirror than a large lens, and also make it parabolic so it does not suffer from [spherical abberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration). As they work on reflection, instead of refraction  mirrors do not suffer from [chromatic abberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration).\n"
