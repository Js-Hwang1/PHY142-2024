The extent to which this happens depends on the wavelength of the light and we will see later that this leads to [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)).\n",

This can be understood based upon the wave nature of light by applying [Huygen's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens–Fresnel_principle). Huygen's principle states that every point on a wavefront can be considered to be the centre of a new secondary spherical wave, and the sum of these secondary waves determines the form of the wavefront at any subsequent time.

    "\n",
    "*The basic cause of the color is atmospheric dispersion : refraction by air is larger at shorter wavelengths. So, at sunset, the refractive delay of the sunset is usually a second or two longer for blue and violet than for red. In general, then, the red image of the Sun (or of some miraged part of it) sets or disappears first, followed by yellow, green, blue and violet.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*So why isn't violet the last color to be seen at sunset? There is another effect at work: atmospheric extinction . Both air molecules and aerosol particles scatter  the shortest wavelengths most strongly (which is why the sky is blue: the strongly-scattered blue light goes in all directions, so we see it when we look anywhere in the sky). At the horizon, the path length through the air is very long, and the shortest wavelengths are almost completely removed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scattering by molecules alone is not quite enough to make the shortest wavelengths invisible; so if the air is very clear, violet is the last color seen. But usually there is enough haze in the air that violet, and even blue, is completely removed, so that green is the last color seen at sunset, or the first at sunrise.*"
