    "The biggest possible size of an object on the eye without the aid of an optical instrument is obtained by placing it at the near point of the eye $N$. If we bring an object closer than the near point then it will occupy a larger angle, but we won't be able to focus on it. This problem can be addressed by a magnifying glass. If we place an object closer than the focal length of the lens, it will produce a virtual image at a distance $d_{i}$. The maximum magnification is achieved by bringing the lens right up to your eye and then arranging the lens, object and your head so that the image is at the near point. To find the magnification we need to know $d_{o}$  which can be found from the lens equation, taking $d_{i}=-N$\n",

An alternative way to use a magnifying glass is to place the object at the focal point of the lens producing an image at $\\infty$. \n",

To have the light be out of phase we need the light that goes through the coating to have advanced by $\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$ for destructive interference to occur. Critically, when destructive interference occurs the light is not lost, but is instead transmitted. As the wavelength of light in a medium is given by $\\lambda=\\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{n}$ where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium and $\\lambda_{0}$ is the wavelength of the light in free space, the thickness of the coating should be $2d_{coating}=\\frac{\\lambda_{n2}}{2}$\n",
