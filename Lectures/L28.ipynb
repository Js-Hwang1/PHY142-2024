    "We saw in our last lecture that light was an electromagnetic wave. We can also reason that if a wave is moving in the $x$ direction there is no reason for it to change it's amplitude or direction if it is traveling in free space. We can thus consider light to travel in straight lines, which we can also see, especially with a collimated light source such as a laser.\n",

The distance between F and the center of the mirror, length FA, is called the focal length, f, of the mirror. The focal point is also the image point for an object infinitely far away along the principal axis. The image of the Sun, for example, would be at F.\n",
